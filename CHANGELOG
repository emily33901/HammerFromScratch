F1_Hammer Changelog:

* changed texture scale to display at infinite precision (within reasonable floating point limits)
* fixed a buffer overflow in the texture finder window
* changed some tools to display their values with greater that 1dp of precision if required

+ allow for less than `1` snap to grid (to an arbitrary minimum of 1/32 unit)
